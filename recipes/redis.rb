# Copy backup file to restore data

# NOTE: This only works because Redis' AOF mode is off.
#
# If AOF is enabled...
# - disable AOF in the redis.conf
# - stop redis service
# - copy over the RDB file (like below)
# - start redis service
# - run `redis-cli config set appendonly yes`
# - re-enable AOF in redis.conf
#
# For simplicity here, let's just keep AOF disabled. (^_^)
